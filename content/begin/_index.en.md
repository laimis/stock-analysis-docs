## What does Nightingale Trading have to offer?

#### We help you understand your stock and option trading performance.

Especially when it comes to options, getting an insight into your profits and losses can be hard.

What's your average rate of return across all trades? How bad are your drawdowns? How high are your max gains? Is your strategy a winning one?

With continuous money being deposited into your account, to get answers to those questions requires work. Nightingale Trading helps you to track smarter, and then provides you with the insights.

### Tracking Shares

Use Nightingale Trading to record your share purchases and sells. We will keep track of all the transactions and over time you can see your performance metrics. How many of your trades result in a profit, how large are you gains, what is your average rate of return, and many other questions will get answered.

With a quick glance you can see your positions and their relevant metrics:

### Tracking Options

Nightingale Trading really shines when you use it to track your option trades. First, we keep options separate from shares so that you can focus on one thing at a time.

Second, at a glance, we provide you with the overview of your open positions that will tell you quickly what is in the money, out of the money, by how much, etc.

The information is kept for you up to date so at any time you know how close you are to being in the money, or out of the money, how many days you have held the contract, etc. These could be important factors in helping you to decide if to close the contract or take any other action.

After you start closing the trades, we will keep track of winning rate, **profit capture** percentage, expected value, average win, the average days held of the position. We will provide you with a really deep insights into your option trading behavior.

We keep the buy and sell side separate as often these are seperate strategies employed by the options traders. But of course, the overall performance is always available to you.

### Stock Alerts

Awareness of price movements is key for entering the trades at the right time. The problem is that we don't have infinite time available to us to watch tickers all day. It's too easy to miss a stock move down to a level where we might consider entering or selling.

Nightingale Trading allows you to setup as many alerts as you like and then pings you when alert is triggered so that you can take action or do an evaluation of the stock.

### Journaling

By recording your transactions you are already ahead of many of the traders. If you keep track of your moves and review your results regularly, you get a clear understanding of your outcomes that's based on statistics and not on perception.

Nightingale Trading goes a step further and allows you to record a thought for any ticket or transaction so that you can keep track of your thinking process and your analysis. The notes are always there for you to refer back and examine, review, and learn.

### Reporting

Nightingale Trading provides you with transcation logs, allowing you to filter down by ticker, by trade type (option or share), and focus in on either just profits/losses and just the transactions.

Here we have an example of a trader trading UBER options, and they can see all of their transactions made and filter them out further. Any ticker that you trade becomes available as a filter in the transactions screen.

Option trades are tracked and offer a really rich performance grid that can tell you exactly how effective you are with your trades.

The reports are continuously growing in their size and usefulness, so check back often for more.
