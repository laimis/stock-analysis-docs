## Why Alerts

It's been said that the best strategy for a long term investor is to buy and keep on buying while selling infrequently.

It's not the same if you are attempting to trade and make gains in a shorter amount of time.

Keeping track of the price movements can be a full-time job, and if you already have another full-time job, it can be very distracting.

Alerts are here to reduce the amount of time you spend tracking stock prices. It will notify you when a stock of your interest crosses through the price point you specify and then you can take action, if you like.
