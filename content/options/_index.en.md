## How to track options

Tracking options begins when you record an opening of your position. You open your option position by either selling one or more contracts, or buying one or more contracts.

Once you close your option contract with your brokarge, you will do the same on Nightingale Trading. This way we will know the outcome of the trade and can record the appropriate statistics for it.

Closing the option involves either selling the options you had bought, buying back the options you have sold, letting them expire worthless, or getting assigned. We will show you how to do all of those in the next sections.

Finally, at any time you can see your option trade performance. This will give you an insight into how well your strategies are working and if you need to adjust a thing or two with your trades.
