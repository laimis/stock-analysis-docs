{{< faq "Does it support tracking option trades?" >}}
Yes! Currently you can record buy or sell transactions. It's perfect for someone who sells PUTS or CALLs. If you are doing a wheel strategy, the site is perfect for you since you can keep track of your share positions as well as the options.

Tracking multi-legged options can be more complicated as each leg needs to be entered and closed individually.
