{{< faq "What's the main purpose of Nightingale Trading?" >}}
It helps you easily track your share and option transactions while providing automated insights into your trading performance.

It is meant to replace the manual trade journals one might do in an excel spreadsheet or on a simple piece of paper.

Trading journal can help you understand your behavior and performance better than a simple intuition. But keeping one is a hassle and we hope Nightingale Trading can make that process easier.

{{< faq "Does it support option trades?" >}}
